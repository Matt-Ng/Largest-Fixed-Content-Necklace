# Largest-Fixed-Content-Necklace
## Abstract
A necklace is the lexicographically least element in a set of all rotations of a string. Fixed-content refers to a list of symbols, where the number of occurrences of each symbol in the list is the same as in a particular string. In this paper, we present an algorithm that finds the lexicographically largest necklace of a content C in $O(n^2)$ time.
